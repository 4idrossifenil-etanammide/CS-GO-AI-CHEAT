# ⚠️ Disclaimer: Uni Project Repo 🚧
Before you dive into this repo, here are a few things you should know:

📌 This repository was created for the course _AI Lab: Computer Vision and NLP (2023)_ – meaning it was built with deadlines, specific exam requirements, and a whole lot of learning along the way.

🛠️ Expect rough edges – You might find some less-than-ideal code, typos, missing documentation, or even bits of unused logic hanging around. It happens.

📚 Not a polished product – This isn't an actively maintained project, so don’t expect updates or refactors. If something looks weird, it probably has a reason (or I just didn’t know better at the time 🤷).

💡 I was learning! – The code here reflects my understanding at that point in time, so don’t judge too hard. Everyone starts somewhere!
